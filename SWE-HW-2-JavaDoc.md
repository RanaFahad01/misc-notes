To make it easier to copy, here they are in plain text:
```java
/**
 * Associates a probability with a country of origin.
 *
 * @param countryId a two-letter country code
 * @param probability a probability, i.e., a number between 0 and 1
 */

/**
 * {@return the possible countries of origin for the last name specified}
 *
 * @param name a last name
 * @throws feign.FeignException if any error occurs
 */

/**
 * CLI for the {@code nationalize} package.
 */

/**
 * {@return an object implementing the {@code NationalizeClient} interface}
 */

/**
 * {@return an optional wrapping the most likely country of origin for the
 * name}
 */

/**
 * Client interface to query the possible countries of origin for a last name.
 * The {@link #newInstance()} method is provided to obtain a
 * {@code NationalizeClient} object.
 */

/**
 * Stores the possible countries of origin for a last name.
 *
 * @param count the number of rows examined
 * @param name a last name for which the possible countries of origin are
 *             predicted
 * @param countries a list of the most likely countries of origin
 */
```
